I certainly feel like it should\u0026hellip;\nPrior to launching this site I had a portfolio which was built with GatsbyJS, which is basically a static site generator that uses react under the hood. The site worked well, but it had a lot of dependencies under the hood, and the codebase overall was complex.\nSome other gripes:\nLong build times Theme I used didn\u0026rsquo;t support blogs Wanted to redesign to a simpler aesthetic Sure I could have made it work, but this is a side project and I have limited time so I looked for other options. Speed was the name of the game here.\nIn comes Hugo # I discovered Hugo as a static site generator and was very impressed with the build times and how fast you could spin up a site. In a nutshell, it takes markdown files and turns them into static sites based on HTML templates which you can modify on your own.\nHugo also has a great library of open source themes that you can use to build whatever kind of site you want. They\u0026rsquo;ve got everything from documentation to personal portfolio sites. Eventually I stumbled on the Blowfish theme which was absolutely packed with features to make it easy to start up, plus it was built with tailwind which I wanted to use anyway.\nThe Result # After a few weekends of working on this here and there, I had a new portfolio site that made it easy for me to show off projects that I made along with some commentary on each project.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a short list of improvements:\nEasy styling with Tailwind Anonymous likes and page views with Firebase 30 second site build times Markdown based blog posts which are very simple to add Fun fact, this site is hosted with Netlify which has a very generous free tier. All I pay for is the domain name \u0026ldquo;joshuaflores.rocks\u0026rdquo;. Total cost per year for this site is around $10.\n","date":"1 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/personal-portfolio/","section":"Projects","summary":"Background # Does this site count towards my personal portfolio?","title":"Personal Portfolio","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"1 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"1 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tailwind/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tailwind","type":"tags"},{"content":" Background # I recently had the opportunity to redesign the website for my parents\u0026rsquo; church, St. Stephen\u0026rsquo;s Episcopal in Forest, VA. My father told me in 2022 that the website, built with Wordpress, was in a state of disrepair and they were going to look for web developers to do the work. I had some previous Wordpress experience so after taking a look at the website, I offered to do the work pro bono as an opportunity to give back.\nProblems Identified # I had a couple of discussions with the priest to understand what he was looking for in the new site and we identified a couple of key issues:\nPoor service from the hosting provider Outdated user interface Inability to dynamically update content on the front page Poor content management experience Solution # I started off by creating a development site using DreamHost since they offered a generous hosting plan. After that, I created new branding and graphics using Figma to establish a consistent look and feel across the site. Then I set up the site using the Blocksy theme for Wordpress and began migrating content. During this time, the priest had access to the dev environment so he could see the site being built in real time and offer feedback along the way.\nAt the end of the process we had a completely redesigned and deployed site with just a few weekends worth of work that exceeded their expectations. From a user experience perspective one of the most endearing things was to see the priest go in there and add events, photos, and other content without assistance from myself.\nScreenshots # Check out the screenshots below to see the before and after.\nBefore After ","date":"1 February 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/ststephensepiscopal/","section":"Projects","summary":"Background # I recently had the opportunity to redesign the website for my parents\u0026rsquo; church, St.","title":"St. Stephen's Episcopal Church","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"1 February 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/wordpress/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wordpress","type":"tags"},{"content":" Background # I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing saxophone with the Fairfax Wind Symphony since the beginning of 2022 and eventually it came up that they needed a new person to administer the site.

Throughout my career, I’ve been the go-to person for creative solutions. My journey began at FIVE GUYS (yes, the burger place), where I was a corporate trainer and traveled around the world opening restaurants and training employees. While I was there I discovered I really enjoyed design work and got my masters in instructional design.\nFast forward a few years and I\u0026rsquo;m doing design work for the government, but I start to get the itch that I need some new skills because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t actaully build the things I wanted to create. One day I\u0026rsquo;m watching the show Silicon Valley on HBO and think to myself \u0026ldquo;Coding looks pretty cool, I want to learn how to do that.\u0026rdquo; So I became self-taught in frontend development and the rest is history.\nThe Things I Value Every designer has a unique set of values that guide their work and decision-making process. These values can vary widely, reflecting different approaches and philosophies within the design field. For me, the following are the core principles that shape my design practice:\nSimplicity - I believe in creating designs that are straightforward and intuitive, ensuring users can easily navigate and engage with the product.\nCollaboration - Working together with diverse teams and stakeholders enriches the design process, leading to more innovative and effective solutions.\nFeedback - I value constructive feedback as it is crucial for continuous improvement and refinement of designs.\nCleverness - Ingenuity and creative problem-solving are at the heart of my design approach, helping to overcome challenges in novel ways.\nGetting things done - I prioritize efficiency and execution, ensuring that ideas are not only conceptualized but also effectively brought to life.\nMy Design Approach 1. Research Great designers prioritize understanding. I seek out opinionated users and develop rapport with them, as their insights are invaluable. Having these users on my side allows me to bounce ideas off them and gather innovative suggestions. By asking a lot of questions and listening intently, I uncover the true needs and goals of the project.\n2. Design Before diving into code, I create visual representations using Figma. I like to create some fast initial drafts, usually over a day or two, and then show them to others to ensure I’m on the right track. This step is integral to my problem-solving process as it helps identify areas of opportunity and ensures alignment and clarity.\n3. Develop This phase involves bringing the design to life. My go-to tech stack includes TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. I also heavily value unit testing with libraries such as Jest and Playwright to ensure future changes don’t break existing work.\nFor websites where users need control over their content, there’s often no better solution than WordPress.\n4. Iterate The process doesn’t end with the initial build. By monitoring user behavior and gathering feedback, we can identify areas for improvement, sparking another cycle of research, design, and build.\n","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"joshuaflores.rocks","summary":"In a nutshell, I’m a senior UX designer and frontend developer with over a decade of experience in both industry and government sectors.","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":" About # Turn based tic-tac-toe game with the ability to name players.
