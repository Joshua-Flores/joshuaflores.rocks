## About

I really can't stand recipe websites, so I created my own with an emphasis on the key user experience features that people really want when they visit a site like this. This site went viral on reddit in 2020. Direct feedback and passive analytics showed that users wanted imperial and metric measurements, search, and a way to browse content. Check out the site to see how those features were implemented.
