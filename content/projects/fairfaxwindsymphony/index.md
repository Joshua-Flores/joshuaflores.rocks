## Background
I've been playing saxophone with the Fairfax Wind Symphony since the beginning of 2022 and eventually it came up that they needed a new person to administer the site. When I got in there I realized that the site was quite out of date in terms of both Wordpress setup and also general user experience. 

I proceeded to perform a redesign using the Blocksy theme and improved the overall content experience across the site by adding upcoming concerts and performer spotlight sections. Now the site features a high quality look and feel which is integral to attracting the best musical talent from the Northern Virginia area.
